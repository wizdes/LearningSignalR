roadmap:
1) when getting the cards, list them correctly (done)
- UI work (done)
- your cards are at the bottom, then back of the cards for all the others (working on that)
  3
2   4
  1

3) clicking on a card brings it to the center (located correctly)
3.5) clicking on a card brings it to the center *for everyone*
4) logic needs to be added: only click on your own cards
5) logic for the first phase (pick up/choose trump)
6) logic needs to be added: only click on your own cards on your turn
7) add logic for points, multiple rounds
8) add animation

V1!

BUG:
1) load all games when loading joining a global session <fixed>
